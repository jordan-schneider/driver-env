This repo is now effectively a fork of https://github.com/avikj/L4DC-MPC-OCD that extracts the environment from interact_drive, plus some additonal building to get a backwards compatible version of the environment from "Active Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions" by Sadigh et. al. with different features. Most of the credit to Lawrence Chan and Avik Jain.

The relevant portions of the original readme follow.
